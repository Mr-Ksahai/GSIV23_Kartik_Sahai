This is a React JS[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
Next.js is a React framework that gives you building blocks to create web applications. By framework, I mean Next.js handles the tooling and configuration needed for React, and provides additional structure, features, and optimizations for the application.

## Getting Started
First, run npm i or npm install in the terminal
Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Briefing about the code
1. The home page has infinite scrolling functionality.
2. The search functionality is working even when some letter of the movie are entered in the search bar.
3. If I could innovate this project on my own then I would implement a play trailer functionality on movie card during hover.
